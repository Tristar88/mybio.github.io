    <h3>Strengths:</h3>
</font>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">
        One of my strengths is public speaking. From I was very young I was never really shy or one to get nervous in front of a crowd. I have always had the confidence that I would do well and not mess up and that helped me to be able to stand before huge crowds
        and speak. Throughout the years I have taken this strength/ability and honed it through debating, which I enojoy maybe a bit too much, and multiple speech competitions.
        <br>

        <br> Another strength I possess is that I have a high affinity with Technology. I have always been able to figure out how technology works whether it be on the software level or on the hardware level, I have just always been able to figure it
        out. And as such I have alaways felt very confortable around tech and anything mechanical. This has helped me a lot through life and even more so now that I have developed it to the point of being able to create tech to some extent.
        <br>

        <br> My last strength that I wish to touch on is my natural writing ability. As a person who has always enjoyed reading books,comics,manga,web novels etc., it has allowed me, along with my natural abilities to possess a high proficiency with writing.
        Sadly however, even after starting multiple books during my school years, I have never finished one despite all the encouragement and my love for it, it just never seemed possible for me to finish one. Hopefully I will one day.

    <h3>Twelve Pillars Summary:</h3>
</font>

<p>
    <font face="Arial">
        <h4><u>Chapters 4-7</u></h4>
        <br>
        <u>Chapter 4</u>
        <br> Chapter 4 talked about Achieving Goals. " I've heard and read many times that you should write your goals down. Writing them brings them into reality. A side benefit of achieving your goals is that you become a better person. "The major reason
        for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it." In addition Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there. Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will
        lead you to a future that you want. Donâ€™t wait for people to set goals for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Chapter 5</u>
        <br> Chapter 5 was about Proper Time Management and using time wisely.There are two types of pain, the pain of discipline, which weighs only ounces, and the pain of regret, which weighs tons. Don't procrastinate, the end of your life will come
        sooner than you expect; don't wait until it's too late. Remember that when you spend a day, you have one less day to spend, so spend each day wisely. "Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity." The best opportunities are
        those that align with your overall goals. Know the difference between the urgent and the important.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Chapter 6</u>
        <br> "Surround Yourself With the Best People" is what Chapter 6 spoke on. "Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high." People have an amazing power to influence your destiny. Every
        relationship you have is an association, be it positive, neutral, or negative. Ask yourself the following questions about your relationships. Who am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got
        me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? What do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself if you're good with the answers. Categorize every person you meet. Is he or she someone you should disassociate with, have
        limited association with, or should you expand your association? Surround yourself with winners, successful people who exhibit and live consistent to values and skills you want to acquire and develop. You become like those you hang out with, so
        be picky.
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Chapter 7</u>
        <br> Chapter 7, "Be a Life-Long Learner." Most of your life is lived after formal education. "Formal education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune." Self education is about what you teach yourself and what you learn
        along the way so you are constantly improving and growing. Learning is the beginning of wealth, health, and spirituality. Read books, observe successful people, reflect on your own experiences; learn what went right and what went wrong.
