            A quote/saying that I live by and try to keep in mind, is one from the great Martin Luther King Jr. <br> <br>
            <i>"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, <br> but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy." <br> <br> -Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>

            <h3>Games</h3>
            I am an avid gamer, been playing games from I was big enough to hold a controller. I have just always enjoyed how I could lose myself while gaming, losing myself in the worlds and mechanics. Gaming was always an escape for me because as a child my family
            was constantly moving so I had a constant pain from losing friends, but games always helped. Even now I can remember playing my first Mario Game on a NES.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            I am a <b>HUGE</b> music fan. I listen <b>ALL</b> genres of music. From pop to hip-hop, from Japanese to Gospel, from Country to R&B. Just to name a few. To me music is also an escape, but it's different from Games. <br> With games it was
            more visual with occasional mental immersion with the story. But with music, it's like my entire mind and body has been transported with whatever I am listening to. <br> It allows me to calm my moods, uplift my mood or even set a mood. Hipd-hop/Rap
            especially has taught me a lot about being a black man, about how to be my own individual, how to treat a woman etc. I really don't know who I'd be if I didn't listen to J Cole,Kendrick Lamar,Russ,Mac Miller,Drake,Logic just to list a few.
            <br> I had even started making music at one point through beats and electronic mixers...didn't go too well.

            <h3>Movies</h3>
            I'm a huge movie buff. I love how well entire crews of people can come together to make something that can be so entertaining and widely enjoyed. It amazed me how revolutionary some filming techniques are compared to ones normally used. From the masterpiece
            that it Fight Club to the well put together universe of Marvel, I enjoy every bit of my experiences with films. Except Horror films, not really a fan. Movies have helped me to realise who I am and what I stand for in life. They have helped
            me to take risks, be a better person, have confidence in myself and just like games and music, movies have helped shape me into the young man I am today.

        <font face="Arial">
            The Personality Test from Similar Minds was a 60 question 'multiple choice' type test where they would give you a question and you would respond with a varying degrees of agreement. I answered each question as truthfully as I could and seen above are
            the results to said test. I went through all the results 50% and over and I was impressed as most of them accurately depicted the enigma that is Matthew Daley. On the other hand some results were not quite accurate but I was still impressed
            on the accuracy this web based test had.
