            This is the Bio of Matthew Lloyd Daley. A second-year student at the University of Technology in Jamaica. Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computing. He is a young man, 20 years of age, a Christian, a lover of Technology, Food, Cooking, Pop Culture etc.
            Personally, he doesn't believe he has done a lot in his life yet, but he strives each day to do batter, be better and to enrich the lives of those around him. However, I am sure you can make your own decisions so come, let us take a journey
            and see just who Matthew is.
